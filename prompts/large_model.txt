Generate a conventional commit message:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

Examples:
fix(auth): handle empty password validation
feat(api): add user profile endpoints
docs(readme): add installation instructions  
style(main): fix spacing and formatting
perf(database): optimize user query
refactor(api): restructure auth system
test(auth): add OAuth tests
chore(deps): update dependencies

RULES:
- Type must be exactly one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Subject: under 70 characters, imperative mood, no period
- Body: 1-4 bullet points explaining what and why
- Output ONLY the commit message, NO additional explanations

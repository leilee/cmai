<body>

Important:
- Type must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Subject: max 70 characters, imperative mood, no period
- Body: list changes to explain what and why, not how
- Scope: max 3 words
- For minor changes: use 'fix' instead of 'feat'
- Do not wrap your response in triple backticks
- Response should be the commit message only, no explanations.

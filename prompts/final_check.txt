FINAL CHECK: If you're thinking "refactor", ask yourself:
- Is this just a small fix? Use "fix" instead
- Is this just formatting? Use "style" instead  
- Is this just performance? Use "perf" instead
- Is this documentation? Use "docs" instead
Only use "refactor" for major architectural restructuring.

ABSOLUTELY NO:
- "This commit..." or "The changes include..." phrases
- Numbered lists or explanatory paragraphs  
- Use ONLY action-focused bullet points!

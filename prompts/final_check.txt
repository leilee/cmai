FINAL CHECK: If you're thinking "refactor", ask yourself:
- Is this just a small fix? Use "fix" instead
- Is this just formatting? Use "style" instead  
- Is this just performance? Use "perf" instead
- Is this documentation? Use "docs" instead
- Is this build config/dependencies? Use "chore" instead
Only use "refactor" for major architectural restructuring.

BUILD/CONFIG CHANGES = "chore":
- Adding/removing files from build systems (CMake, gyp, Makefile)
- Updating dependencies, package.json, requirements.txt
- Build script modifications
- Configuration file updates

ABSOLUTELY NO:
- Use ONLY action-focused bullet points!

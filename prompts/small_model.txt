Generate ONLY a conventional commit message in this format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

COMPLETE EXAMPLES:

Add missing domain check to prevent invalid emails
→ Use "fix" for: bug fixes, small corrections, validation improvements

feat(api): add user profile endpoints  
Implement GET/PUT /api/users/{id}/profile for user data management
→ Use "feat" for: new features, new capabilities, new functionality

docs(readme): add installation instructions

→ Use "test" for: adding tests, test modifications, test fixes

chore(deps): update security dependencies

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use words other than: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Small changes = fix (NOT refactor)
- Documentation = docs (NOT chore)  
- Formatting = style (NOT refactor)
- Performance = perf (NOT refactor)
- Only major restructuring = refactor

STEP BY STEP:
1. Look at the changes
2. Pick the RIGHT type from the examples above
3. Choose a short scope (1-3 words)
4. Write subject under 70 chars, no period
5. Add body explaining what and why
6. Output ONLY the commit message, NO additional explanations

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- "This commit..." or "The changes include..." phrases
- Numbered lists (1., 2., 3...)
- Explanatory paragraphs
- Meta-descriptions about the commit

Generate a commit message for these changes:

## File changes:
<file_changes>
{changes}
</file_changes>

[<body>]

Important:
- Type must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Subject: max 120 characters, imperative mood, no period
- Body: Optional. Only add if the change needs context. Use 2-3 brief bullet points describing the core change and its purpose
- Scope: max 3 words

- Do not wrap your response in triple backticks

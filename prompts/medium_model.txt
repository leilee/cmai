Generate ONLY a conventional commit message in this format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

CRITICAL RULES:
- Type must be exactly one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- NO explanatory text like "This commit..." or "The changes include..."
- NO numbered lists or detailed descriptions
- ONLY use bullet points with action-focused statements

GOOD EXAMPLES (follow this concise style):

feat(api): add user profile endpoints
- Added GET/PUT endpoints for user data management
- Implemented profile validation

docs(readme): add installation instructions  
- Added setup guide with pip and source installation
- Updated usage examples and configuration

style(main): fix spacing and formatting
- Corrected indentation and spacing issues
- Applied consistent code formatting

perf(database): optimize user query performance
- Replaced inefficient loop with indexed query
- Improved connection pooling

refactor(api): restructure authentication system
- Split monolithic auth module into separate services
- Reorganized middleware architecture

test(auth): add OAuth validation tests
- Added comprehensive token validation tests
- Implemented edge case testing

chore(deps): update security dependencies
- Upgraded vulnerable packages to latest versions
- Updated build configuration

fix(utils): improve email validation logic
- Added domain validation check
- Fixed edge case handling

CRITICAL TYPE SELECTION RULES:
• fix = Small corrections, bug fixes, validation improvements (NOT refactor)
• feat = New features, new capabilities  
• docs = README, documentation changes (NOT chore)
• style = Formatting, spacing, indentation (NOT refactor)
• perf = Performance optimizations (NOT refactor)
• refactor = Major restructuring, architectural changes ONLY
• test = Adding/modifying tests
• chore = Dependencies, build config, maintenance

FORMAT RULES:
1. Type MUST be exactly: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
2. Scope: 1-3 words maximum
3. Subject: under 70 characters, imperative mood, no period
4. Body: Use bullet points with short, specific descriptions
5. Output ONLY the commit message, NO additional explanations
6. KEEP IT CONCISE - follow the bullet-point style shown above

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- "This commit..." or "The changes include..." phrases
- Numbered lists (1., 2., 3...)
- Explanatory paragraphs
- Meta-descriptions about the commit

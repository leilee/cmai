Generate conventional commit message:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

CORE RULES:
- MUST have empty line between subject and body
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, chore, perf, test, refactor
- Use bullet points for body

BODY STYLE - KEEP CONCISE:
- Use short, action-focused bullet points
- NO full file paths (use just filename or class name)
- NO verbose descriptions or repetitive details
- Combine similar operations when possible
- Max 1-2 lines per bullet point

TYPE GUIDE:
• feat = new features/capabilities
• fix = bug fixes, broken functionality  
• docs = documentation changes
• style = formatting, spacing, indentation
• refactor = major restructuring
• perf = performance optimization
• test = adding/modifying tests
• chore = dependencies, build config

Generate ONLY a conventional commit message in this format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

RULES:
- Type must be: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- NO explanatory text like "This commit..." 
- Use bullet points for body

EXAMPLES:

- Reorganize code architecture for better maintainability

test(auth): add OAuth validation tests

chore(deps): update security dependencies

TYPE RULES:
• style = spacing, formatting, indentation (NOT bug fixes)
• fix = broken functionality, errors, bugs (NOT improvements)
• chore = dependencies, build config (NOT fixes)
• perf = performance optimization (NOT refactoring)
• refactor = major restructuring (NOT small fixes)
